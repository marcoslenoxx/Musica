Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It s the way I m feeling I just can t deny
But I ve gotta let it go");

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away  cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It s the way I m feeling I just can t deny
But I ve gotta let it go");

Now we re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine mine, mine, mine");
